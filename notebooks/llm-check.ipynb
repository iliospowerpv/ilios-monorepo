    "message = \"The world is a vast and diverse place, encompassing countless countries, cultures, landscapes, and experiences. It is a planet rich in natural wonders, from towering mountain ranges and expansive deserts to lush rainforests and deep oceans teeming with life. The world is also home to billions of people, each with their own unique stories, traditions, and ways of life.\\n\\nGeographically, the world is divided into seven continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. These continents are further divided into countries, each with its own government, history, and cultural identity. Some of the world's most populous countries include China, India, the United States, and Indonesia, while others, like Vatican City and Nauru, have relatively small populations.\\n\\nThe world is a tapestry of diverse religions, languages, and belief systems. Major religions such as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism have followers across the globe, while countless indigenous and local belief systems also play a significant role in shaping cultures and communities.\\n\\nThroughout history, the world has witnessed remarkable achievements in science, technology, art, and human endeavor. From the ancient wonders of the pyramids and the Great Wall of China to modern marvels like the International Space Station and the internet, humanity has continuously pushed the boundaries of what is possible.\\n\\nHowever, the world also faces significant challenges, including poverty, conflict, environmental degradation, and climate change. Addressing these issues requires global cooperation and a commitment to sustainable development, human rights, and the preservation of our planet's natural resources.\\n\\nIn today's interconnected world, the actions and decisions of one nation or community can have far-reaching consequences for others. As such, fostering understanding, respect, and cooperation among the diverse peoples and cultures of the world is essential for creating a more peaceful, just, and prosperous future for all. How much is 2 + {0}?\"\n",
