* **Unbalanced Termination Rights:** The contract grants the Company the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement in specific situations (e.g., Customer exceeding capacity, lack of production) while not providing the Customer with the same rights, directly violating the rule against one-sided termination clauses. 
* **Lack of Customer Cure Period:** The Company can terminate the contract if the Customer exceeds capacity or fails to produce energy without granting the Customer a grace period to rectify the situation, creating an unfair advantage for the Company.
* **Unclear Reciprocity for Insolvency:** The contract allows the Company to terminate if the Customer faces insolvency but lacks clarity on whether the Customer has a reciprocal right if the Company experiences similar financial distress, further contributing to the imbalance in termination rights.
