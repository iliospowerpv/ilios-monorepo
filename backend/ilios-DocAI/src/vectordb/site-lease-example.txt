(b) Tenant may extend the Initial Term for three (3) additional five (5) years periods (each a
Renewal Term" and collectively, the “Renewal Terms") by providing written notice to Landlord sixty
(60) days' prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or immediately preceding a Renewal Term. The

(c) During the Initial Term, Tenant shall have the right to terminate this Lease in the event
that its power purchase agreement, or other agreement under which Tenant provides power generated at

such termination is caused by Tenant. Upon a termination of this Lease by Tenant permitted hereunder,
this Lease shall terminate and become null and void, and Tenant shall have no further obligations
hereunder other than those obligations incurred prior to the effective date of such termination.
(d) Prior to the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall refine the site layout design and
obtain a survey of the Premises (the "Survey”). The parties agree that the Survey's legal description shall
be incorporated into Exhibit A as if fully set forth therein without amendment to this Lease, and that for
purposes of determining the amount of rent payable hereunder, the size of the Premises as shown on the
Survey (the "Net Acreage") shall be binding on the parties hereto. If requested by Tenant, Landlord shall
execute a consent to the foregoing or an amendment to this Lease expressly incorporating the Survey into
Exhibit A as provided in this Section.
(e) Tenant shall have three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the Effective Date to inspect
the Premises to determine if it is suitable for the Intended Use (the “Due Diligence Period"). If Tenant
is unable to satisfy the Contingencies (as defined below) to Tenant's satisfaction prior to the end of the
Due Diligence Period, or if Tenant otherwise determines prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period that
Tenant's leasing of the Premises is not feasible or desirable for any reason whatsoever, Tenant may
terminate this Lease by giving written notice to Landlord prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period.
Tenant's obligation to perform hereunder shall be subject to the satisfaction of the following
contingencies (collectively the "Contingencies”): (i) Tenant obtaining all necessary approvals from state,
federal and local authorities required by Tenant to construct its proposed improvements and to operate the
Premises for the Intended Use (as hereinafter defined), (ii) Tenant's review and approval of title and
survey matters with respect to the Premises, the environmental condition of the Premises and the physical
condition of the Land and (iii) Tenant's review and approval of any other matters that Tenant deems
relevant to determining whether Tenant's leasing of the Premises is economically and otherwise feasible.
As part of Tenant's due diligence, Tenant shall be entitled to conduct such testing of the Premises as
Tenant shall reasonably determine in its sole discretion, including without limitation, one or more
environmental audits, and to physically inspect and review the Premises, which investigation shall be of
such scope as Tenant shall determine. Provided, however, Tenant's due diligence shall be conducted
within the following parameters: (i) Tenant shall notify the Landlord prior to entry on the Premises and
inform the Landlord of the nature of the due diligence being conducted on the Premises, (ii) such entry
would not interfere with the development or construction of projects on sites adjacent to the Premises in
the reasonable discretion of the Landlord, (iii) Tenant and its employees and agents do not enter onto the
sites adjacent to the Premises without written permission from the Landlord and (iv) such due diligence
does not include invasive testing (excluding geotechnical and pull testing) or full site mobilization for
construction except as may be approved by Landlord in writing, which may include email
correspondence.
