# of Trackers,"## Finding # of Trackers in a Solar Site Lease Agreement

**Prompt:**

Given a solar site lease document, identify and extract the number of solar trackers present on the leased premises.

**Keywords and Patterns:**

* **Explicit Mentions:**
    * ""# of Trackers""
    * ""Number of Trackers""
    * ""Quantity of Trackers""
    * ""Tracker Count""
* **Contextual Clues:**
    * Look for sections discussing the solar equipment or system specifications.
    * Search for numerical values near terms like:
        * ""trackers""
        * ""single-axis"" or ""dual-axis"" (common tracker types)
        * ""tracking system""
        * ""solar modules"" or ""PV modules"" (trackers typically hold multiple modules)
* **Consider Units:**
    * The number might be followed by units like ""trackers"" or simply listed as a standalone numeral.
* **Eliminate Irrelevant Information:**
    * Ignore references to ""Fixed Tilt"" or ""Sheds on ground"" systems, as these don't utilize trackers.
    * Disregard numbers related to other equipment like inverters, transformers, or meteorological stations.

**Example:**

In the phrase:
>""The System will consist of 85 single-axis trackers, each equipped with...""

* ""85"" is the number of trackers.
* ""single-axis"" confirms the equipment type as trackers.

**Important Note:**

The document might not explicitly state ""# of Trackers."" Use your best judgment based on the context and keywords provided to identify the most likely numerical value representing the tracker count.",0,,# of Trackers
