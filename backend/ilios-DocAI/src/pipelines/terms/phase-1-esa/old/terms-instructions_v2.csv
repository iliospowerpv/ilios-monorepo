Who is this addressed to,,"## Identifying ""Who is this addressed to"" in an Environmental Site Assessment Report

**Prompt:**

Given an Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) report, identify and extract the section that specifies the individual or entity to whom the report is addressed. This is typically a stakeholder such as an investor, lender, or regulatory body.

**Keywords and Patterns:**

* Look for phrases like:
    * ""Prepared for""
    * ""Addressed to""
    * ""Submitted to""
    * ""Attention:"" or ""Attn:""
* Identify company or organization names, often followed by identifiers such as:
    * LLC (Limited Liability Company)
    * Inc. (Incorporated)
    * Corporation
    * Trust
    * Government agencies (e.g., EPA, State environmental agency)
* Look for individual names, potentially followed by titles like:
    * President
    * CEO
    * Project Manager
    * Loan Officer
* Pay attention to addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses that might be associated with the recipient.

**Example:**

In the phrase:

>""**Prepared for: DuQuoin Solar, LLC
>718 W Business Highway 60
>Dexter, Missouri 63841**""

* ""Prepared for:"" clearly indicates the intended recipient of the report.
* ""DuQuoin Solar, LLC"" is the company name.
* The following lines provide the company's address. 

This approach helps identify the intended recipient of the ESA report by focusing on common phrases and patterns used to denote the addressee and their associated information.",1
RECs (Y/N and $ amount),,"## Finding RECs (Y/N and $ amount) in a document

**Prompt:**

Given an environmental assessment document, identify and extract sections of text that indicate whether Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) are involved and, if so, their monetary value. 

**Keywords and Patterns:**

* **Existence of RECs:**
    * Look for explicit mentions of ""RECs"" or ""Renewable Energy Credits.""
    * Search for phrases indicating the presence or absence of RECs, such as:
        * ""evidence of RECs""
        * ""no RECs identified""
        * ""RECs in connection with the property""
    * Pay attention to variations in capitalization and phrasing.
* **Monetary Value:**
    * If RECs are mentioned, look for numerical values and currency symbols (e.g., $, €) that might indicate their value.
    * Search for phrases like:
        * ""value of RECs""
        * ""RECs valued at""
        * ""cost of RECs""
    * Consider that the monetary value might be expressed as a total sum, a price per unit, or a range.

**Examples:**

* **Example 1 (RECs - No, Value - N/A):** ""This assessment has revealed no evidence of RECs in connection with the Property.""
* **Example 2 (RECs - No, Value - N/A):** ""AEI did not identify evidence of RECs or CRECs in connection with the subject property during the course of this assessment.""
* **Example 3 (RECs - Yes, Value - To be determined):** ""The project will generate RECs, the value of which will be determined at a later stage."" 

**Output:**

Provide the extracted text that answers both:

1. **RECs (Y/N):**  Indicate ""Yes"" if RECs are mentioned as present or potentially present. Indicate ""No"" if the document explicitly states there are no RECs or provides no mention of them.
2. **$ amount:**  If a specific monetary value is mentioned, extract the relevant text. If no specific value is given, indicate ""Not specified"" or ""N/A"".",0

* ""32998 South Highway 213"" is identified as a potential street address.
* ""Molalla, Clackamas County, Oregon"" provides the city, county, and state information.
* ""(the ""subject property"")"" further confirms this is the address of assessment.",1

* **Example 3:** ""**PROJECT NUMBER T121333  SUBMITTED ON July 19, 2021**..."" (Pay attention to capitalized headings near dates) 

**Instructions:**

Given an Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) document, identify and extract the date on which all field work required for the ESA was completed at the site.

* Consider the context of the entire sentence and surrounding sentences to ensure the date refers to the completion of field work and not just the start date or a specific activity.

>""A site reconnaissance was performed by Jonathon Grubbs... to document existing site conditions. The site reconnaissance was conducted on **July 9, 2021**, from approximately 11:00 a.m. to 11:50 a.m....""

* ""Site reconnaissance"" and ""document existing site conditions"" suggest field work was conducted.
* ""July 9, 2021"" is identified as the date this activity took place, making it a likely candidate for the ""Date of Field Work Completed on ESA"".",0
