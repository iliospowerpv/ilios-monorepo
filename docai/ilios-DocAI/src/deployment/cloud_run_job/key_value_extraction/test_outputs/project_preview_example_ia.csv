* **Unilateral Termination by Customer:** The phrase ""either Party"" explicitly grants the Customer the right to end the agreement with 30 days' notice, violating the rule against unilateral termination.
* **Lack of Mutuality:** The language does not require both parties' agreement for termination, making it one-sided and in violation of the rule promoting mutuality in termination provisions. 
* **Absence of Specific Grounds:**  The original text allows termination for any reason with only a notice period, contradicting the rule that termination should be based on specific and justifiable grounds.
