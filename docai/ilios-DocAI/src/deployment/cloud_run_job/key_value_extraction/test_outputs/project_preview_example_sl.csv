**Unclear Calculation Logic:**

* **Vague Metrics:** The text relies on undefined terms like ""Expected Capacity"" and ""Gross Revenues"" for rent calculations, creating ambiguity and potential for disputes over payment amounts. 
* **Missing Definitions:** While referencing ""Gross Revenues (as defined below),"" the text fails to provide a clear definition, leaving the scope of this crucial term open to interpretation and disagreement.
* **Ambiguous Payment Terms:** Despite mentioning ""payment in arrears,"" the agreement lacks a defined grace period and late payment penalties, potentially leading to disputes over late payment consequences.

**Prepayment Required:**

* **Multiple Pre-Construction Payments:** The text mandates various pre-payments like ""Initial Pre-Construction Rent,"" ""Pre-Construction Rent,"" and ""Storage and Staging Area Rent"" before the Commercial Operation Date, directly violating the rule prohibiting any form of pre-payment.
* **Potential First Month Rent Pre-Payment:**  The phrase ""payable in arrears throughout the Term"" for Base Rent Installments raises concerns about the first month's rent potentially being due at the lease commencement, constituting a pre-payment.
