9. Termination

* **Unilateral Termination Right:** The contract grants the Contractor a right to unilaterally terminate the agreement under certain conditions. This directly violates the rule stating that neither party should hold this power.
* **Absence of Mutual Consent:** The current termination clause lacks a requirement for mutual consent between both parties before initiating the termination process, contradicting the rule's stipulation. 
* **Lack of Cure Period:** The text doesn't mention a mandatory ""cure period"" following a breach of contract, which would allow the breaching party time to rectify the issue before facing termination. This omission violates the rule's intention of promoting fairness and dispute resolution.

3. For non-payment after 15 day notice period","The relevant section containing information about termination by the customer is Section 9:

9. Termination
a. By Either Party: 
i. Either Party may terminate this Agreement immediately if the other Party has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, is the subject of an involuntary petition in bankruptcy, has been adjudicated as bankrupt or insolvent, or has made an assignment for the benefit of creditors.  
b. By Owner: Owner may terminate this Agreement for default upon written notice if Contractor breaches a material term of this Agreement and fails to cure such material breach within thirty (30) days of such written notice.
c. By Contractor: If Owner fails to comply with any of its obligations in Section 7 of this Agreement or fails to pay Contractor any amount by the Due Date (and there is no bona fide dispute between the Parties as to amounts owed hereunder), then Contractor may, upon fifteen (15) days written notice to Owner, suspend performance of all Services hereunder and/or terminate this Agreement. Owner remains liable for all Services performed by Contractor up through and including the date of termination."," Yes, the contract contains poison pill provisions that grant unilateral termination rights to the Owner and Contractor under certain conditions, allowing either party to terminate the agreement without giving the other party a fair chance to remedy any breaches or issues.",1,"## Rule Violation Explanation:

*   **Unilateral Termination by Owner (Section 9b):** The text violates the rule because it allows the Owner to terminate the agreement immediately for a material breach, even if the Contractor is actively trying to fix the issue within the allowed 30-day period. This denies the Contractor a fair chance to remedy the situation and constitutes unilateral termination.
*   **Unilateral Termination by Contractor (Section 9c):**  The text violates the rule by granting the Contractor the right to terminate if the Owner fails to meet certain obligations, without requiring the Contractor to provide the Owner a reasonable opportunity to rectify the situation. This creates a situation where the Contractor can unilaterally terminate the agreement.
